Java MazeGenerator Program

The MazeGenerator Program is a java program that randomly generates a maze given dimensions by the user. 
After generations, the user will be prompted to type 'start' to begin the maze solving program.

The maze solving program utilizes depth-first search to recursively search for the the end of the maze 
at the top right and beginning at the bottom left. The start and end would be indicated by blue boxes. 

The maze solving program would be animated and indicated by the magenta colored path, the grey boxes
indicate spaces already explored with the program avoiding said areas. 

The user will then be prompted to end the program if wished or to click exit to stop the process.

NOTE: StdDraw, StdOut, and StdRandom are all programs from the StdLib and used to help the processes for the
program.
